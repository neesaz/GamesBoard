"""Standard ship types for the Battleship game.

   Author: Russ Lewis

   Defines a function for each of the well-known ship types in Battleship;
   the function creates a new Ship object every time that it is called.
   The code in this module builds a standard shape, which always includes
   the point (0,0); the caller passes these functions a 'rot' field, which
   is used to rotate the shape before we pass it to the Ship constructor.

   Primary functions:
      Carrier   (rot)
      Battleship(rot)
      Cruiser   (rot)
      Submarine (rot)
      Destroyer (rot)

   Utility functions:
      rotate_shape(shape,rot)

"""Main program for Battleship

   Author: Russ Lewis

   Creates a board.  Right now, the code hard-codes the board in one of two
   arrangements: a standard one, using 5 standard ship types, and a "tetris"
   one, where the board (kind of) looks like a Tetris game in progress.

   After creating the board, enters a while loop, which runs until
